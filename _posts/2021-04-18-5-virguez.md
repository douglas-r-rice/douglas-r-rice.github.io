I have been working with a sample of  ~ 1,125 amicus briefs filed by different citizens and interest groups. For this blog post, I will use the *summaries* from 624 briefs filed by different actos from civil society (not governmental agencies) and use topic modeling to see the most common topics, the legal participation of these actors around these topics, and the most influential briefs' topics. Because we don't have any data base of the Colombian Constitutional Court's opinions and the petitions and briefs filed before it - thus, we don't have a clear idea about the most discussed topics in the court - using topic modeling will useful to organize the amicus briefs into defined themes. Again I use a **tidy approach** to provide a better analysis of the content of the briefs.

## Finding the topics
After uploading the data and the packages necessary for the analysis, I begin by trimming the text and creating, again, a customized set of stop words in Spanish.

```
library(rvest)
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringi)
library(tm)
library(textclean)

AMICUS <- read.csv("AmiBriefs.csv")
AMICUS$SUMMARY <- trimws(AMICUS$SUMMARY)  

#Custom stop words in Spanish
custom_stop_words <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-es/master/stopwords-es.txt", stringsAsFactors = F)
custom_stop_words$lexicon = "custom"
colnames(custom_stop_words)[1] = "word"
```

Then, I use the function ('unnest_tokens') to tokenize, in words, the text of the summaries of the amicus briefs. In the process, I exclude a list of words that are not stop words in Spanish but are commonly used in the legal document and which do not provide any interesting information. As you can see, the count will be organized by "AMICI_TYPE", that is the type of actor filing the brief - common citizens, NGOs, labor unions, trade guilds, think tanks, and universities. I will do the same for "AMICI_NAME" to se the topics in which some specific actors participate, and for "MATCH" to see what briefs' topics have better coincidence with the outcomes of the opinion (I  will explain this measure below).

```
token_counts <- AMICUS %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, SUMMARY) %>%
  filter(!(nchar(word) < 4)) %>% 
  filter(!(nchar(word) < 4)) %>% 
  filter(!(word=="artículo")) %>%
  filter(!(word=="constitución")) %>%
  filter(!(word=="derecho")) %>%
  filter(!(word=="constitucional")) %>%
  # ...
  anti_join(custom_stop_words) %>%
  count(AMICI_TYPE, word, sort = TRUE)
```

Then I use the function called *cast_dtm()* from the tm package to convert the token_counts into a document-to-word matrix, where the variable "AMICI_TYPE" will be used for the rows and "word" as the column.

```
AMICUS_dtm <- token_counts %>%
  cast_dtm(AMICI_TYPE, word, n)
```

Now, I use the dtm to fit a topic model using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) from the topicmodels package. For this case I will use a k = 5 (number of topics). I set the seed directly inside the function so that we are certain to all get the same results. Once I have this done, I use the *tidy()* function from the tidyr package to extract the beta coefficients which provides weights for the words with respect to topics. Finally, I use *top_n()* function to grab the top 10 words per topic.

```
library(topicmodels)
amicus_lda <- LDA(AMICUS_dtm, k = 10, control = list(seed = 1234))

#Beta coefficients
amicus_lda_td <- tidy(amicus_lda, matrix = "beta")

#10 top terms

top_terms <- amicus_lda_td %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  top_n(10, beta) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta)
```

We could create a table with the top terms, instead I use ggplot2 package to plot the top words by topic as a series of bar plots. As you can see, there are 5 topics and following the top words in each topic we can what are those topics about. 

1st topic: *LGBTQ+ rights* (words like "parejas" or couples, "homosexuales", "dignidad" or dignity, "humanos" or humans which is related to human rights, and so on)

2nd topic: *Justice Reform* (words like "rama" or branch, "independencia" or independence, "consejo" or council which is the administrative organ from the judicial branch, and so on)

3rd topic: *Heatlh Care* 

4th topic: *Finantial System* 

5th topic: *Peace Agreement* (popular referendum around the peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla)

```
library(ggplot2)

top_terms %>%
  mutate(term = reorder_within(term, beta, topic)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor (topic))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_reordered()
```

## Topics by type of actors
If we want to look at the extent to which each document or amici type is composed of each topic, we can  set matrix = “gamma” to get the gamma values, which tell us exactly that.

```
amicus_lda_gamma <- tidy(amicus_lda, matrix = "gamma")

top_topics <- amicus_lda_gamma %>%
  arrange(document, -gamma)

#Select the type of amici actors and plot
selected_amicus <- c("NGO", "UNI", "TRADE", "LABOR", "CITI", "THINK")
top_topics %>% 
  filter(document %in% selected_amicus) %>%
  ggplot(aes(topic, gamma, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:20) +
  facet_wrap(~ document, scales = "free") +
  theme_bw()
```

NGOs' participation is focused on LGBTQ+ rights (which has also participation by universities). Common citizens' briefs are focused around constitutional challenges against the financial system, think tanks (usually legal expert ones) and labor unions focus on justice reform (which can be explained by the active participation of "Asonal Judicial", one of the most important unions in the country whose memebers are judicial officials including clerks and lower court judges). Universities' briefs moved around the peace agreement and its referendum. The trade guilds participated on the discussions around the health system.

Running the same analysis using the variable "AMICI_NAME" gives us more information about the specific amici participation of individual actors or organizations. I selected the "ANDI" (National guild of Colombian businessman) a trade guild, "Dejusticia" (Center of Law, Justice, and Society) an NGO, and the "Instituto Colombiano de Derecho Procesal" (Colombian Institute of Procedural Law) a think tank. Their topic participation is consistent with overall analysis.

```
# ... 

AMICUS_dtm <- token_counts %>%
  cast_dtm(AMICI_NAME, word, n)

# ... 

selected_amicus <- c("ANDI", "DEJUSTICIA", "INSTITUTO COLOMBIANO DE DERECHO PROCESAL")
top_topics %>% 
  filter(document %in% selected_amicus) %>%
  ggplot(aes(topic, gamma, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:20) +
  facet_wrap(~ document, scales = "free") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Topic modeling and the influence of the briefs
Because each amicus brief can have multiple petitions and the rulings can have multiple decisions, to measure their "influence" in terms of outcomes I first took the number of matching pleadings or petitions (the pleadings that were adopted by the court) and divided it into the total number of decisions provided in the opinion to obtain a matching quotient. A perfect match has a quotient of “1”, while a half- matching pleading has a quotient of “0.5”, and a perfect incongruity has a quotient of “0”. Then, I clustered the ‘match quotients’ into three values: Match for all the quotients above 0.8, Partial Match for all the quotients between 0.5 and 0.79, and Not Match for all the quotients below 0.5. In simple terms, I define that only an amicus brief that predicts more than half of the final decisions can be considered as an influential (or partially influential) intervention.

Using the variable MATCH I can fit a topic modeling to see the level of 'influence' for each topic.

```
# ... 

AMICUS_dtm <- token_counts %>%
  cast_dtm(MATCH, word, n)

# ... 

selected_amicus <- c("Match", "Not Match", "Partial Match")
top_topics %>% 
  filter(document %in% selected_amicus) %>%
  ggplot(aes(topic, gamma, fill = factor(topic))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:20) +
  facet_wrap(~ document, scales = "free") +
  theme_bw()

```
