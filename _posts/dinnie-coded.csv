betts7,estefierote,1,"He couldve set a limit, if robinhood has 1billon to cover only allow users to deposit up to 1 billion. Isnt that why it takes time for your deposits to go through. Paying for gold status gives you instant deposits so in other words your deposit gets ahead of the line and you might be part of the 1 billion they have. Same thing is supposed to happen with banks. People let the bank take care of their money so technically there should only be the amount the people deposit maybe a little extra for the fees. So if people need to take it out it should be there, right? Errr great depression showed us otherwise and what happenes to all that money poof gone people died, suicides, people killed each other to survive while the rich stayed safe with all the money they stole.",1
PackageDelivered,PackageDelivered,5,"I'm not sure what experience trading you have. In the last year or two, its been really easy to buy meme stonks, wait, and collect 25%+. If I had to talk to myself before I began trading, I would say, ""Invest regularly even if the market as a whole is going down. Invest in things you know about. Primarily buy shares. Gamble with on options with money you can lose. Lose several times before you actually gamble on something big so you know the consequences. Learn as you go."". I say all of this from a very biased perspective. I've been lucky and I realize that too.

ZeusThunder369,EnderSword,47,"Uh... Yeah.

The one word you're not hearing in any of these discussions is 'Concentration'

There's pre-existing rules and limits in place that govern not only margin, but how much of a person or firm's risk can be concentrated into one thing.

When you had a little company like Robinhood show up not only looking to max out their capital position but put like 80% of it into one stock trading 1000% above its all time high... would you lend them like $5 billion? Even for 1 night?  


Their error in my opinion was not explaining this when they did it, and also pulling the trigger all at once.   


There's a series of steps they should have put in to place, like going from 30% to 50% to 100% margin requirements smoothly instead of a firm halt.",3

Minimum-Watercress-8,nanmart,3,"I dont think either DD situation is the low hanging fruit PLTR is addressing.

Clients are no longer married to one corporate law firm. And cost is on everyones mind.

Imagine a BigLaw client wants to know if UK issuers bonds can be sold in EU country A. A few days later they ask about country B. Then C. Client looks at the 3 bills and wonders at what point they are paying BigLaw to reinvent the wheel with each new EU jurisdiction they request.

Enter PLTR. The analysis of UK issuers debt in countries A/B/C is now at the fingertips of everyone. Depending on how the question is researched, its possible the answer to countries D/E/F/G etc. are now immediately known.

Now the seismic shift can happen, where this BigLaw firm can reach out to potential UK clients and say if your considering a debt offering, our PLTR tool can instantly navigate all the various regulations in the different EU members.

BigLaw has shifted from *responding* to proactively advising. Thats the foot-in-the door BigLaw needs to cross sell other practice groups.",3

Telandra,TheTeaSpoon,3,"Czech here. I started doing some part-time jobs in 2008. First month I got like 300EUR (about 10000CZK). The next month I was given a raise... but also [super-gross salary](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/09/flash-alert-2020-408.html#:~:text=15%20percent%20rate.-,Background,contributions%20paid%20by%20the%20employer.) was introduced. My payslip was -30EUR lower (I suddenly made 9000 CZK after getting a raise) despite me getting like 20EUR raise.

That one hurt me. Finally it has been abolished this year. I get extra 150-ish EUR now. For 13 years of working I was shorted out of at least 50EUR a month (when I started working full-time it was closer to the 100) by my government with their tax fuckery (which made taxes in general real convoluted process). The president was extra petty by not signing the decision of the parliament which delayed the abolishment for extra month... made me lose about 13-15k EUR which would have really helped me over the 13 years (e.g. getting a mortgage instead of renting would have been attainable).

There are only 2 compelling technologies out there from others that I find interesting. (1) Lordstown Motors, in-wheel motors. I don't know how well this works (I suspect it will pose many more issues and will be of limited use case), but it offers the ability to design a car without a drive shaft which allows you to build a car in an innovative way and (2) Quantumscape solid-state batteries. They seem to be the real deal. I still think the 4680 batteries are more important for the next decade (I think they will be scalable a lot easier), and in any case Tesla will have solid-state 4680 cells eventually, but solid-state batteries will be in crazy high demand and will be very profitable.",4

Get TD Ameritrade's ThinkorSwim program. I think there's a mobile app as well but their desktop software is great.

Set up a paper trading account and just start messing with buying/selling options. Paper trading will use fake money but real world values.

I would hugely advise learning ""the greeks"" at the very least before trading with real money, and understand how those numbers and IV % will affect the actual value of each contract.

Options are inherently dangerous because you risk your entire investment, and contract prices can move counter-intuitively. Paper trading to get a good feel of how it all reacts to share price and momentum is a great way to start.",4

It wouldn't let me buy to close because the original position was initiated as a 'Sell to Close'.


I got Schwab on the phone before I did anything (watching my losses pile up while was on hold).  When I finally got a rep, he told me to buy to open enough contracts to eliminate any market risk.  Fortunately there had been a pull back by then and it wasn't such a bad loss.

-Workin-it-,AmericanMurderLog,1,"GME is still trying to squeeze based upon high float, but all of the new AMC stock recently issued means there will be no squeeze for AMC.  2020 has been a damaging year, with AMC taking on over $1B in new debt, while issuing over 340 million new shares just drafted out of the ether.  Somehow their market cap is now higher than at any time during 2019, so the stock is fundamentally overpriced.

I agree that AMC is a strange stock, and good news could light a speculative fire, however the investment industry is also looking at all of this and their average target price after all of the 2020 dilution and debt is $2.51.  I think the unanimous alignment around those targets makes any sort of run unsustainable.  You also have Wanda sitting on 50M shares they just converted from class B to class A, which was clearly done to allow them to liquidate them.

What they do is force drivers to deliver stuff, which leads to lower quality compared to competition(OZON is basically carbon copy of AMZN, even started from selling books). They want a piece of every pie, but the quality of services sucks. Except their high tech, if you want to get anywhere in CIS you use yandex, Google and Apple maps just don't do the job. Same with search engine. Want reliable info - use yandex. Even though google does ok job, but it just not as good for every day use in Russia. So long term it's a bet who will be Russian AMZN, and YNDX is serious competitor, but they could lose because literally every major market player in russia are trying to create their own Amazon like services.",2

EntropicTempest,ChemicalRascal,1,"I mean, yes, but actually no. You can work this shit out fairly accurately academically. Maybe not down to the cent, doesn't need to even be down to the dollar. But you can certainly get the first digit right.

A reasonable price is based on an estimate of a company's future profits. That's how stonks work. Yes, people disagree on estimates of future events, that's why a market exists in the first place. But you can sit down and do the fundamentals, and determine if a price of 70, 50, or 30 is ""reasonable"".

And 70 isn't. 50 isn't. The resulting market caps would take a _truly_ incredible change in GameStop's fortunes to justify. Yeah, it might happen, but that's like saying a car might drive through my bedroom window while I sleep, it's not something you plan for.
