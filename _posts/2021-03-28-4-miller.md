I spoke with a Sociology PhD student who is doing similar work on Twitter. He directed me to "Analyzing Polarization in Social Media: Method and Application to Tweets on 21 Mass Shootings" by Demszky et al (2016). All of the code used in this paper is accessible [here](https://github.com/ddemszky/framing-twitter). This code is in Python, but I'm going to try to follow the general principles in my work later on. 

In the mean time, I REALLY need to get this text cleaned-- I've been spending a lot of time trying to conceptualize my questions and dataset overall so I definitely need to spend time working with my text variable itself.

Creating a corpus and *actually saving it this time*: 

```{r}
library(tidytext)
library(plyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(quanteda)

Sharpie <- read.csv("SharpieGate.csv")
SharpieCorpus <- corpus(Sharpie, text_field = "text")
saveRDS(SharpieCorpus, file = "SharpieCorpus.rds")
```

Time to tokenize! I'm removing punctuation, symbols, URLs, and english stop words. I'm not going to remove numbers (yet), because I could see folks typing out important dates numerically. 
```{r}
# removing punctuation, symbols, and urls
SharpieTokens <- tokens(SharpieCorpus, remove_punct = TRUE, remove_symbols = TRUE, remove_url = TRUE)

# converting to lowercase
SharpieTokens <- tokens_tolower(SharpieTokens)

# goodbye English stop words
SharpieTokens <- tokens_select(SharpieTokens, pattern = stopwords("en"), selection = "remove")

# checking this out
print(SharpieTokens)

# saving
saveRDS(SharpieTokens, file = "SharpieTokens.rds")
```

Let's make a DFM and explore these features!
```{r}
SharpieDFM <- dfm(SharpieCorpus)
SharpieDFM

topfeatures(SharpieDFM, 20)
```
Hm, I'm seeing a lot of symbols and punctuation which I thought I removed previously. I'm going to be more explicit with the dfm function.
```{r}
SharpieDFM <- dfm(SharpieCorpus,
                  tolower = TRUE,
                  remove_punct = TRUE,
                  stem = FALSE,
                  remove = stopwords("english"))
topfeatures(SharpieDFM, 20)
```

Okay, tad less gross. I need to remove symbols though, I'm seeing a lot of those.
```{r}
SharpieDFM <- dfm(SharpieCorpus, remove_symbols = TRUE)
topfeatures(SharpieDFM, 20)
```

Oh, oops, looks like I need to run all of args, because I see a lot of punctuation here.
```{r}
SharpieDFM <- dfm(SharpieCorpus,
                  tolower = TRUE,
                  remove_punct = TRUE,
                  stem = FALSE,
                  remove = stopwords("english"),
                  remove_symbols = TRUE) #removing symbols
topfeatures(SharpieDFM, 50)
```
Let's try stemming this-- I see "trump" and "trump's" as separate tokens.
```{r}
SharpieDFM <- dfm(SharpieCorpus,
                  tolower = TRUE,
                  remove_punct = TRUE,
                  stem = TRUE, #changed this
                  remove = stopwords("english"),
                  remove_symbols = TRUE) 
topfeatures(SharpieDFM, 50)
```

I don't like the URLs being there. I found a way to remove them using the tokens function:
```{r}
SharpieTokens <- tokens(SharpieTokens, remove_url = TRUE)
saveRDS(SharpieTokens, file = "SharpieTokens.rds")

SharpieDFM <- dfm(SharpieCorpus,
                  tolower = TRUE,
                  remove_punct = TRUE,
                  stem = TRUE,
                  remove = stopwords("english"),
                  remove_symbols = TRUE) #removing symbols
topfeatures(SharpieDFM, 50)
```
HAHA I realized my earlier mistake-- I needed to use SharpieTokens rather than SharpieCorpus as my argument for dfm. No wonder none of the punctuation etc. was still there... I hadn't removed them in my corpus object! (I am feeling like *quite* the silly goose right now)

```{r}
SharpieDFM <- dfm(SharpieTokens, stem = TRUE)
topfeatures(SharpieDFM, 25)
```
Okay, I still see Ã¢ and I dislike that. Looks like I need to remove non ASCII characters-- I found the iconv() function for corpuses and will give it a try.
```{r}
SharpieTokens <- iconv(SharpieTokens, from = "UTF-8", to = "ASCII", sub = "")
SharpieDFM <- dfm(SharpieTokens, stem = TRUE)
topfeatures(SharpieDFM, 50)
```
Success! I'm saving the updated SharpieTokens and also the dfm (I hadn't saved work from the previous blogs so I am learning from that mistake):
```{r}
saveRDS(SharpieTokens, file = "SharpieTokens.rds")
saveRDS(SharpieDFM, file = "SharpieDFM.rds")
```

Let's make a word cloud.
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
textplot_wordcloud(SharpieDFM, min_count = 50, random_order = FALSE)
```

Okay, now that my text is cleaned, I need to think more seriously about my overall analysis. In my Social Networks class I'm using this same dataset to essentially do an elite study. I'm going to do a power law distribution to figure out the influencers within my network (more than the top 10 that I had identified previously) and look at their identifying characteristics. I plan on creating a binary variable indicating if a user is an influencer or not. From there, I'll use a topic model (which we'll learn about next week) to investigate how these influences change the conversation surrounding Sharpie Gate. Stay tuned!
