There is more involved in public behavior than cognition - emotions drive us. What an individual feels or experiences drives their behavior. As such, sharing, helping, or pursuing a course of action is preceded by certain activated emotions. Emotions are being widely studied in behavioral sciences and are a relevant component of human nature. The news media remains a valued source of information in the United States about politics and conflict for several people. Zaria Gorvettthe, in a BBC news article, posits that news changes our behavior and the way we think. According to Strapparava and Mihalcea (2008), news headlines, for example, are typically made up of words written by authors who have the intention "to provoke emotions, and consequently to attract the readers' attention." This gives the media power to influence the opinion and perceptions of readers, viewers, and listeners through the emotions they provoke. Therefore, I hypothesize that news articles with a high empathetic narrative will lead to some form of intervention by the international community.

There have been instances where the public does not treat two issues of the same magnitude with equal significance. Hard cases of this instance are centered around international attention to and intervention in global conflict. I use the case of Bosnia and Somalia in this study. The conflicts in Bosnia and Somalia were two of the most gruesome humanitarian crises witnessed in the 1990s and had similar body counts and similar instances of intent to kill. However, one was officially labeled a genocide by the United Nations, and the other was not. Given that both conflicts met the criteria for what genocide is, why is it that Bosnia was labeled a genocide, but Somalia was not? Could it be that the narratives of the news stories about the two conflicts were different? Was one framed more emphatically than the other? 

This paper will employ a database of news reports on the conflicts. This study's corpus is 150 hand-coded articles from a previous research work I undertook with a group of researchers. The study draws on news stories from the Boston Globe, New York Times, and Washington Post. The paper aims to map out and analyze the news articles' narrative to ascertain the narratives' emotional undertones. I seek to use various methods, including topic modeling and word clusters, outputting some visualizations to figure out the narratives within news reports on the Bosnia and Somalia conflicts. Measuring news articles' emotional content is vital for this research that seeks to quantify emotions from unstructured text.
