The project I worked on in this class is part of a three-part dissertation study. The three-part study uses multiple methods in the measurement of empathy. The third part of the project involves measuring empathy through text.

The project for this class focuses on the text analysis part of the study. I hypothesize that news articles with empathic narratives will lead to some form of intervention. However, how do we identify the narratives of event data? What narratives are in news stories that elicit empathy? I seek to solve this puzzle through an in-depth analysis of the text through a bottom-up approach; Word frequencies, Dictionaries, Topic Modeling, and Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA). This study aims to identify emotionality and the narratives in the news articles about the conflicts in Somalia and Bosnia. Based on the skills I acquired in this class, I am building an event database about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen since my dissertation focuses on the Yemen crisis.

My last blog post highlighted the frequent words in the corpus and the significant challenges I was facing with my data. It was a messy dataset that needed a lot of straightening up. After surmounting that challenge, we combined the Washington Post and New York Times news sources into one corpus. An issue worth noting is that, upon countless tries, the NYT scrapper was not functioning correctly, so we could not get the news headlines for the NYT articles in the dataset. This issue did not significantly impact our analysis. However, we decided to build a dataset of Washington Post news articles about the Yemen crisis for the dissertation project. 

Moving on from that issue, I run word frequencies with the data we worked on and combined. The network plot showed words like 'serb' at the center of the network with 'united states,' 'war,' 'muslim,' and 'refugee.' However, words like 'somalia' and 'mogadishu' were at the peripheral of the network. The wordcloud we generated shows 'serb', 'serbian,' 'bosnia,' united nations,' and 'war' as words with very high frequencies. However, 'somali' and 'somalia' seem to occur not as frequently as words associated with Bosnia. This output of word frequencies makes it obvious and supports the work of earlier scholars that Bosnia was reported on more than Somalia. This outcome makes me wonder whether it was a combination of the immense reporting on Bosnia and emotions that resulted in the intervention in Bosnia and not in Somalia. We then moved on to conduct semantic and emotional analysis.

We run an emotionality analysis with the quanteda NRC dictionary. The NRC dictionary has emotions like anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. We run the emotionality analysis with these four emotions, and it was interesting to see some high ratings of anger and fear compared to disgust and sadness. This output seems to make sense since scholars have found that empathy, in some cases, also arouses anger, and at times, it is a combination of empathy and anger that gets people to intervene in a crisis. Though we were able to analyze the emotionality of the text, there was no way I could explore how empathic the narrative of the text was, so we moved on to run topic models. The reason for running the topic models was to find out what topics were salient in the text. So we run LDA and STM models.

In this paragraph, I will talk about what we found with our topic models. Our barplot of the document topic distribution of the top 10 words showed that topics 6 and 7 have the highest proportion was obvious. Topic 6 has ~ 39% and topic 7 ~ 35%. However, when we run lda_model$plot(), it showed that the terms for topic 1 made up 12.4% of tokens -that was the highest. I was curious to know the words associated with the topics, so in the LDA model, I explored the different words in each of the ten topics. I found that some words associated with topic 1 are; 'slavs,' 'conference,' 'resolution,' 'sanctions,' 'protect,' 'declared,' 'good,' 'minister,' 'minority,' 'church,' 'send,' 'agree,' 'stay.' These words seem to be associated with an agreement or maybe a treaty. We also run a correlated topic model with the number of topics as 5 (K <- 5). The output of the model was a fascinating one. The top words shown with this model are slightly different, but one will notice that the topics relate to Bosnia with words like 'serb,' 'bosnia,' 'jew,' and 'serbian.' Topics 1 and 5 are related to Bosnia, while topics 3 and 4 are related Somalia. We ran a structural topic model to explore the data further to ascertain much clearer topics. Instead of selecting one K for the structural topic modeling, I chose different Ks where K = c(3,9,12). It was not surprising to see that seven of the topics were about Bosnia, three about Somalia, and one about the United States and United Nations. We specified the model with k <-  3 and run labelTopics(myModel). We found that The three topics were mostly about Bosnia (topics 1 and 3).

Overall, it was very informative to find the frequency of word occurrences, sentiments and emotionality, and topics within our text data. We found that words related to Bosnia frequently appear in our data, as well as topics related to Bosnia. One other thing worth noting is the sentiment analysis. It was essential to know that using the NRC dictionary in R, we could find word-emotion associations. It was evident that words associated with the emotion of fear and anger were high. This finding ties in well with findings of previous studies by scholars in Psychology who found that it was a combination of anger and empathy which caused people to intervene in crises. In the quest to find the role of emotions, specifically, empathy in prosocial behavior pertaining to humanitarian crises, this was a good starting point. Knowing the emotionality rating of the text confirmed the fact that emotionality did drive the decision to intervene in the Bosnian conflict. This finding also supports our findings in a previous study we conducted.

Our previous study was about emotion-based framing. We sought to find out whether emotion-based framing of conflicts in Somalia and Bosnia was a factor in Bosnia being labeled a genocide while Somalia was not, even though the two conflicts were comparable on multiple levels. In line with our hypothesis, we found out that the Bosnia news articles had a high emotionality compared to those of Somalia. One reason we gave for the high emotionality content of the Bosnia articles was that reporters were writing from Bosnia and saw firsthand what was happening on the ground. Therefore, it is not surprising that we see several topics related to Bosnia in this current text analysis project. I will further analyze the narratives within the existing text data I have on Somalia and Bosnia to determine whether there are elements of empathy present.

It is worth noting that the analysis we carried out in this class was exploratory and preliminary. The outcome gives us an idea of what is going on with the text. We are running another analysis of the same kind with the methods we employed for the current study on text data about the Yemen crisis. The Yemen humanitarian crisis has been going on since 2015, but it seems to get little attention compared to the case of Syria. My goal is to find the emotionality of the news articles about Yemen and the articles' narratives.
