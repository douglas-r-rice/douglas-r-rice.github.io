In my last blog, I created a function that would parse through my corpus of podcast episodes looking for guest names before and after certain phrases. Since then, I have used nineteen different searches with this function to succesfully identify the names of 772 unique individuals who appeared as guests on 1,108 podcast episodes of a corpus of 5,698 episodes.

For this week, I used a new corpus that I will continue to use for the rest of this project. Previously, I had used a snowball-ish-sampled corpus that started with a single political podcast and included other podcasts featuring names included in that podcast. However, the named entity recognition in Python which fueled that sample was very unsupervised and the podcasts it ended up including were not very intentional or representative of the topic of interest; many quickly branched away from politics. While I may still be interested in using a snowball method to sample podcasts in the future, for the scope of this class project I decided to begin anew by looking at the top 30 podcasts listed on Spotify's *News & Politics* category for a more objective look at the political podcast industry. This list actively fluctuates, however, the top 20 or so seem fairly stable in their rankings. I looked at the list on April 1st and searched for episodes of those podcasts from the last year previous to that date. 

I manually searched for 27 of those 30 podcasts using an API in Python - omitting two podcasts that output very short news updates, the *BBC Minute* and *Snacks Minute* as well as *Dateline NBC*, which is a true crime podcast which made its way into Spotify's "News" category. I then ran a long looped code in Python (as detailed in one of my early blog posts) to scrape the metadata of all of the episodes of those podcasts from the last year. I arrived with a dataset 5,698 unique podcast episodes from those 27 podcasts, which I subsequently read into R.

At this point, I followed a similar process as shown in my previous blog posts to create a corpus and tokenize the text, and then used the `guestlook` function that was described in detail in the last post to search for guest names that appeared on those podcasts. In the past, I had created my corpus out of the *descriptions* of podcast episodes; this time around, I additionally created a corpus of the *titles* of podcast episodes. I searched from both corpuses using slightly different criteria because some podcasts will list their guests blatantly in the titles, ex. "Guest: ...", "Interview with...", while many others mention guests in context in their episode descriptions.

It was a long and laborious process to actually determine which phrases to search for in the descriptions and titles of the podcast episodes to identify guests. It involved a lot of trial and error as well as some additional thinking to write the searches with regular expressions. I am pretty satisfied with the nineteen searches - illustrated below - that I ended up with, but I am sure I missed some more obsure ones. The code below is a list of searches with `guestlook()`, the function I made last time and which you can check out in more detail in my previous post.

```
#looking at descriptions
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # talk with...
          what = "^talk[s]*$ (^with|^to)$", win = 15, look = "post",
          lookbefore = TRUE, beforewhat = " about ", restart = TRUE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # ...talks with
          what = "^talk[s]*$ (^with|^to)$", win = 4, look = "pre",
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # joined... 
          what = "joined", win = 15, look = "post",
          lookbefore = TRUE, beforewhat = " to ", restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # ...joins
          what = "joins", win = 10, look = "pre", 
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # guest...
          what = "guest$", win = 10, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = TRUE, beforewhat = " , ", restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # ...guests
          what = "guests$", win = 15, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # sits down with...
          what = "^s[i|a]t[s]*$ down with", win = 10, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = TRUE, beforewhat = " to ", restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # speaks with...
          what = "^speak[s]*$ (with|to){1}$", win = 10, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = TRUE, beforewhat = " about ", restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # spoke with...
          what = "spoke (with|to){1}$", win = 10, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = TRUE, beforewhat = " about ", restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # featuring...
          what = "featuring", win = 15, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = TRUE, beforewhat = " from ", restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = top_tokens,    # ...stops by
          what = "stops by", win = 15, look = "pre", 
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)

#looking at titles
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = title_tokens,  # guest: ...
          what = "guest[s]*$ :", win = 10, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = title_tokens,  # ... guests
          what = "guest[s]*$ [^:]", win = 5, look = "pre", 
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = title_tokens,  # interview: ...
          what = "interview :", win = 10, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = title_tokens,  # interviews...
          what = "interviews$", win = 10, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = TRUE, beforewhat = " , ", restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = title_tokens,  # interview with...
          what = "interview with", win = 10, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = TRUE, beforewhat = " , ", restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = title_tokens,  # (with ...)
          what = "\\( with", win = 5, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = title_tokens,  # w/ ...
          what = "^w$ \\/", win = 5, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)
namevector <- guestlook(tokens = title_tokens,  # feat. ...
          what = "^feat$ \\.", win = 5, look = "post", 
          lookbefore = FALSE, beforewhat = FALSE, restart = FALSE)
```

This process takes a few hours to run on my computer so it's a little difficult to experiment with. I had to test each regular expression separately and then convert it into the `guestlook()` function once I was satisfied with it. Once it was finished I made sure to save the output as an `.Rdata` file so I don't have to re-run that every time I want to revisit this code.

This ends up finding guest appearances from 1,018 different episodes. That's just under one fifth of the corpus, which I was pretty happy with. From manual review, it all seemed to work - I searched for a few guest names that only would have appeared from certain `guestlook()` searches and they all appeared on the other side.

The output from all of that is a giant list, so next I had to append the names in that list back onto my corpus, its docvars, and the original dataset. In order to do that I have to mess around a bit with `stringr` to mesh together concatenated and unconcatenated lists of names into single strings for each episode.

```
x_rows <- nrow(top_summary)
# for summary docvars
top_summary$fixednames <- NA
for (i in 1:x_rows) {
  if (is.null(namevector[[i]])) {
    next
  }
  top_summary$fixednames[i] <- namevector[[i]] %>%
  toString() %>%
  str_c(sep="", collapse=", ") %>%
  str_replace_all("c\\(","") %>%
  str_replace_all("\"","") %>%
  str_replace_all("\\)", "")
}
docvars(top_corpus) <- top_summary
# for original for easy text comparison
top$fixednames <- top_summary$fixednames
```

Now, for episodes with multiple guests I have to isolate those unique guest names. I found the maximum number of guests on a single episode, then, using two extremely useful tidyverse functions, `separate()` and `pivot_longer()`, split the strings of guest names into that many columns (with the help a crude custom function I made called `makecolumns()`), and wrangled those columns into rows so that the output is a dataset of all unique guest features. I then clean up the dataset so that it contains only two columns: the show name and the guest name. So, if a single podcast episode contained two guests, it is now represented by two rows. If a single podcast episode contained no guests, it is at this point removed from analysis.

```
maxnames <- top$fixednames %>%
  str_count(", ") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  max(.,na.rm = TRUE)
features <- top %>% 
  separate(
    fixednames,
    sep = ", ",
    into = makecolumns(maxnames),
    fill = "right") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    starts_with("name"),
    names_to = "whichguest",
    names_prefix = "name",
    values_to = "guestName",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) %>%
  select(guestName, showName) 
```

At this point the dataset contains 1,910 features, or 1,910 pairs of shows and individual guests who appear on those shows. I then do some final cleaning to format all names so that first, middle and last names are separated by underscores and hyphenated names are merged together. Having the names in a consistent format will help me collapse the list into one of unique names later on.

I also remove one-word names from the dataset because they are often mentions of non-guests that were mistakenly picked up from my function, either referencing a well-known last name, ex. "Biden" in "The Biden administration" or referring to a host of the podcast, ex. "Dan" in "Dara Lind talks to Dan".

```
features$guestName <- features$guestName %>%
  str_replace_all("_-_","") %>%
  str_replace_all("_-","") %>%
  str_replace_all("-","") %>%
  str_replace_all("__","_") %>%
  str_replace_all("_[\\w]{1}$","")
features <- features %>% 
  mutate(
    namelength = sapply(strsplit(features$guestName, "_"),length)
    ) %>%
  filter(namelength > 1)
```

The 1,666-row dataset is just about finished now. I save the **features** dataset of all guest appearances as well as a 855-row **uniquefeatures** dataset of all unique guests for each podcast, i.e. if the same guest appears on the same show more than once, they are not counted each time, but if the same guest appears on multiple shows they are counted for each show individually. This data - what individual guests are shared by different shows - will be the focal point of my final analysis.

```
uniquefeatures <- features %>%
  group_by(showName) %>%
  distinct(guestName)
#save data
save(features, uniquefeatures, file="features.Rdata")
```

For illustration of what this all looks like, here is a screenshot of a small slice of the final **uniquenames** dataset, which evidently includes data about guests and podcasts from all over the political spectrum.

This data has potential for interesting network analysis from either a show-focused or guest-focused perspective. Just from the data shown above, from a guest-focused perspective you can see that Benjamin Merkle, Bill Bean, Bill O'Reilly and Bill Richmond are all connected by commonly appearing on *The Glenn Beck Program*, while from a show-focused perspective, *The Michael Knowles Show* and *Louder with Crowder* are connected by commonly featuring Ben Shapiro as a guest.

Looking at the data broadly, 23 of the 27 podcasts originally included in this corpus made it into the final dataset. Popular but strictly news-focused podcasts like NPR's *Up First* and CNN's *5 Things* are less conversational and therefore do not feature guests and did not appear. Of the 23 top podcasts included, *The Glenn Beck Program* clocked in with the most guest features, bringing 219 unique guests onto the show over the last year. *The Daily* was second at 103 and *Pod Save America* was third at 67.

The next and final step of this project will be converting this data into a network and conducting network analysis. Admittedly, it's been a little while since I've done network analysis so I will have to refresh myself on the best way to convert the data I have into a matrix - but I know the guest-show pair format I have is a good place to start.
