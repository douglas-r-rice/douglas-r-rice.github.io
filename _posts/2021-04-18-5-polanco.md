In this post I'm trying to run a structural topic model over the vector of dissertation titles of my data set. My approach this time will be to follow our colab tutorial but with my own data set so I can get some exploratory results and start to frame better a research question relative to what I have done so far.   


```

rm(list = ls())
#Open the data set built previously 
load("C:/Users/ASUS/OneDrive - University of Massachusetts/textdata/blog/df_bp3.RData")


# Creates string of combined lowercased words
tokens_title <- df$title %>% tolower()

# Performs tokenization
tokens_title <- word_tokenizer(tokens_title)

# Prints first two tokenized rows 
head(tokens_title, 2)

#I create an interator over each token 
it_titles <- itoken(tokens_title, ids = df$n, progressbar = FALSE)

# Built the vocabulary
v_titles <- create_vocabulary(it_titles)


```

One of the first interest things I can observe from following the steps of the tutorial using the titles vector of my data set is its balanced result: term_count and doc_count are take the value one for every term in the vocabulary. This result is not surprising considering that we are only using the dissertation titles and not a bigger corpus of text. In this case I'm going to choose to not prune the vocabulary given that its dimensions are quite narrow (975x3). 

```

# Creates a closure that helps transform list of tokens into vector space
vectorizer_titles <- vocab_vectorizer(v_titles)

#Creates document term matrix
dtm_title <- create_dtm(it_titles, vectorizer_titles, type = "dgTMatrix")
```


Now that I have created a DTM matrix I can create my topic model. I'm going to choose only two topics, because my intuition tells me that first I need to see how the model behaves only in one dimension. I might find a first "polarity" in my data.  



```
# Creates new LDA model
lda_model <- LDA$new(n_topics = 2, doc_topic_prior = 0.1, topic_word_prior = 0.01)


# Fitting model
doc_topic_distr <- 
  lda_model$fit_transform(x = dtm_title, n_iter = 1000, 
                          convergence_tol = 0.001, n_check_convergence = 25, 
                          progressbar = FALSE)

#Graph of topic distribution for first dissertation 
barplot(doc_topic_distr[1, ], xlab = "topic", 
        ylab = "proportion", ylim = c(0, 1), 
        names.arg = 1:ncol(doc_topic_distr))


#Histogram of the vector 
hist(doc_topic_distr[,2])

```

Indeed, I do find some sort of polarity in the distribution of the data. Around 40 observations trend to be absolutely weighted only for one topic and in the other also a similar number does the same, while a relatively uniform distribution is obtained for the remaining approximately 170 observations. I think this give me enough information to keep working with a topic model with $k=2$. 

What is the theory behind my intution of looking for some sort of polarity in the data? As I have previously mentioned, the particularity of UMass economics department is its heterodoxy. However, the pluarlity of economic thinking also have been fostered as a research orientation in the department. So, to identify if there is a heterodoxy/ortodoxy dimension is what I would like to resolve first.
