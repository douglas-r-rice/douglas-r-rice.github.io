As I stated in my previous blog post, I focused on implementing dictionary methods within my dataset this week. I played around with different dictionaries to examine sentiment in reddit comments. These dictionaries mainly looked at the polarity in sentiments (i.e., AFINN, general inquiry) or frequency of specific emotions in text (i.e., nrc). Given that my dataset comes from a "finance" related community on Reddit, I also wanted to use a more domain-specific dictionary to examine sentiment considering the financial context. I used Loughran-McDonald sentiment lexicon specifically created for sentiment analysis within financial documents. Though reddit comments are not conventional financial documents, it was worth looking into how this dictionary would capture sentiments while discussing the stock market on an online forum compared to more broadly used dictionaries. Loughran-McDonald dictionary creates labels  with six sentiments that are essential in financial contexts: "negative", "positive", "litigious", "uncertainty", "constraining", and "superfluous". Based on the wordcloud generated by the results of this dictionary approach, it seems that negative sentiment overrides all other sentiments in the reddit comments. I thought this was interesting as other dictionary approaches did not capture much of a difference between the frequency of positive vs. negative sentiments in the corpus, or provided mixed findings. 

I first tried liwcalike() to estimate sentiment in percentages using NRC dictionary. Then following last week's tutorial, I converted my corpus to DFM to examine the counts of sentiments and compare the polarity measure across 3 different dictionaries.  

```{r }
redditSentiment_nrc <- liwcalike(my_corpus, data_dictionary_NRC)
names(redditSentiment_nrc)

redditSentiment_nrc$polarity <- redditSentiment_nrc$positive - redditSentiment_nrc$negative
ggplot(redditSentiment_nrc) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(polarity)) + 
  theme_bw()
```

I created names for each dataframe including the df_LM and compared the estimates for polarity scores. I expected df_lm polarity measure to perform better then afinn and geninq, however when I tried to create a polarity measure for LM, the code gave me an error. I used the same code as those used to convert dfm to AFINN and General Inquirer but got the following error message : "Error in `$<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, polarity, value = numeric(0)) :#replacement has 0 rows, data has 39734". I need to figure out how to create a polarity measure for LM in the next couple weeks as I plan on using it for my data analysis. 


```{r }
## create polarity measure for LM 
df_lm <- convert(df_lm, to = "data.frame")
df_lm$polarity <- (df_lm$positive - df_lm$negative)/(df_lm$positive + df_lm$negative)
df_lm$polarity[which((df_lm$positive + df_lm$negative) == 0)] <- 0

#  create polarity measure for AFINN 
df_afinn <- convert(my_corpus_text_dfm_afinn, to = "data.frame")
df_afinn$polarity <- (df_afinn$positive - df_afinn$negative)/(df_afinn$positive + df_afinn$negative)
df_afinn$polarity[which((df_afinn$positive + df_afinn$negative) == 0)] <- 0

# create polarity measure for general inquiry  
df_geninq <- convert(my_corpus_text_dfm_geninq, to = "data.frame")
df_geninq$polarity <- (df_geninq$positive - df_geninq$negative)/(df_geninq$positive + df_geninq$negative)
df_geninq$polarity[which((df_geninq$positive + df_geninq$negative) == 0)] <- 0

colnames(df_afinn) <- paste("afinn", colnames(df_afinn), sep = "_")
colnames(df_geninq) <- paste("geninq", colnames(df_geninq), sep = "_")
colnames(df_lm)<- paste("lm", colnames(df_lm), sep = "_")


sent_df <- merge(df_lm, df_afinn, by.x = "lm_doc_id", by.y = "afinn_doc_id")
sent_df <- merge(sent_df, df_geninq, by.x = "lm_doc_id", by.y = "geninq_doc_id")

```

I wanted to visually see how LM dictionary was parsing out the word counts in my corpus so I used a wordcloud. The wordcloud showed that the negative sentiments were more frequently captured using LM dictionary compared to positive and other finance-related sentiments. I thought this was interesting as AFINN and general inquiry did not report more negative sentiments than positive ones.  

```{r }
redditSentiment_LM <- dfm(my_corpus, 
                            tolower = TRUE,
                            stem = FALSE,
                            remove_punct = TRUE, 
                            dictionary = data_dictionary_LoughranMcDonald)
textplot_wordcloud(redditSentiment_LM)
```
