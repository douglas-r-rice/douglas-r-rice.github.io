As mentioned in the previous blog post, I'm working with the constitutional review decisions or 'opinions' issued by the Colombian Constitutional Court (CCC) from 1992 to 2019. The CCC exercises two types of constitutional review. On the one hand, it exerts “concrete constitutional review”, where te court selects an individual case – or a plural number of  cases with similar facts – of alleged violations of constitutional rights that have been ruled by a lower court and reviews the main arguments of the decision. Those individual cases reach the courts through a legal mechanism called 'tutela'. On the other hand, the CCC exerts “abstract constitutional review” by analizing the constitutionality (compliance with the constitutional provisions) of lower range laws or statutes. So, we have 3 types of opinions:

**'Concrete review or "Tutela":** Identified by the letter **'T-'** ... #docket ... year (i.e. T-406/92)

**'Concrete review similar cases or "Sentencias de Unificacion":** Identified by  **'SU'**, #docket, year (i.e SU-111/95)

**'Abstract review or "Constitucionalidad":** Identified by a **'C-'** ... #docket ... year (i.e. C-056/16)

The total number of opinions are 25,855, where 73% are **'T"**cases, 25% are **'C"** cases, and 2% are **'SU"** cases.

## Scraping the Opinions from the CCC's Website

Although I already have all the files of the CCC's opinions downloaded in my computer, I will show how it is possible to download them automatically using the 'revest' package.

```{r}
library(textreadr)
```

Simply go to to website where the file is hosted and copy the link embedded in the 'download' button. In my case, the structure of this link is pretty similar to the url of the page that contains the file: "https://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentencias/2011/T-909-11.htm". As you can see, the link has the year of the opinion (as "2011" and "-11"), the type of case ("T-"), and the docket number ("909"). This structure makes the loop easier because you just need to change these character with range of numbers ([0:9]) or letters ([T\|C\|SU]) according to the years,docket numbers, and type of decisions. The only difference with the download link seen above is that it replaces the ".htm" to ".rtf", that is the extension of the file.

```{r}
url_tutela <- "https://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentencias/2011/T-909-11.rtf" 
```

Then, I just used the function "download.file" to download the .rtf file and save it in a specific folder. One interest thing is that this file, which has an .rtf extension, is actually a .doc file (no idea why). So, to import the text to R I used the function read_docx, instead of the read_rtf function.



### Importing the Opinions to R 

To extract the text from the .rtf files (which are actually docs), I used the 'textreadr' package.
```{r}
library(textreadr)
```

I took all the files and included them in "file.names".

```{r}
file.names <- dir("/Applications/No-iCloud/Opinions_CCC", pattern = "*.rtf", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE) 
head (file.names)
```

Then, I used the function 'lapply' to apply the same function 'read_docx' (the one thaty let me extract all the text from the files) to every single file in the document. Of course, remember that we are working with 25,000+ files, so this takes a lot of time. Once I had all the text data from the opinions, I organized it into a data frame, where every row is an opinion and the columns are each paragraph of the opinion. It is possible to work with just one column containing a string with all the paragraphs, but having multiple columns for multiple paragraphs would work better for the future analysis of the information.

```{r}
opinions <- lapply(file.names, FUN = read_docx)
opinions <- do.call(rbind, opinions)
head(opinions)
```

Finally, we can export the DataFrame to a CVS file

```{r}
write.csv(opinions,"//Users//SantiagoVirguez//Library//Mobile Documents//3L68KQB4HG~com~readdle~CommonDocuments//Documents//UMass//Spring 2021//Text as Data//Amicus_Brief", row.names = FALSE)
```

We are ready to start analyzing the data!
