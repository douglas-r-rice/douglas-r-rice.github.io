# Text-as-Data 2021 Course Blog

Hello and welcome to the course blog for Text-as-Data (POLSCI 797TA; DACSS 697D). In this course, students learn the fundamentals of text-as-data research, with an introduction to the field and broader theoretical considerations followed by an exploration of a host of different methodological approaches using text-as-data. The focus is on *exploration*, with students --- motivated by central research questions --- exploring the opportunities, challenges, and limitations of different approaches. 

In this space, students will *chronicle their exploration*. The goal is not to report results of weekly analyses but rather to discuss the voyage. Posts will track students from considering their broader research project and interests through to the completion of a poster presentation. What's working or not working? What new concerns or problems are cropping up? What interesting avenues for future exploration are opening up?
